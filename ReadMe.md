Project Description:

This is my final digital resume for CodeSpace Capstone Project
I have built from the ground up a full working, presentable digital resume which includes all the content i have learned throughout the course. 
Positioning was one challenge i faced when working with responsive design and something i can work on for future projects.

How to use:

My top navigation bar you can jump to varies parts of my resume 
If you hover over my interests they will play an animation using CSS
My form you can fill in and submit information you input straight to my email
You can click on my social media icons to take you to the varies 
all links / websites will take you to a seperate webpage excluding the top navigation bar which is only internal linking.
